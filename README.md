# Superpressure_Balloon_Calc

A python superpressure balloon calculator:
- Calculates the expected float altitude for three shapes of 'Mylar' balloon with Helium or Hydrogen fill
- Based extensively on the work of [Richard Meadows](https://richardeoin.github.io/sp/) and [Vincent E. Lally](https://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/technotes%3A20)
- Plots what the float altitude and superpressure could be for varying amounts of Gamma (volume / initial volume)

Also included is a macro-enabled Excel spreadsheet which will calculate the float altitude for the 'Mylar' balloon
- Based extensively on the [Balloon_Calculator](https://github.com/PaulZC/Balloon_Calculator)
